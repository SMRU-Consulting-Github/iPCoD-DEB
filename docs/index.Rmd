# Background

iPCoD is a protocol for implementing an interim version of the Population Consequences of Disturbance (PCoD) approach for assessing and quantifying the potential consequences for marine mammal populations of any disturbance and/or injury that may result from offshore energy developments.The protocol has been developed by a team of researchers at the University of St Andrews and SMRU Consulting Europe, led by Prof. John Harwood and has been been extensively used by regulators and developers.

One of the key areas that the scientific community working on PCoD has focussed on in recent years is the relationships between the amount of disturbance experienced by an individual and its vital rates (survival and the probability of giving birth). These relationships are often referred to as transfer functions. In iPCoD, expert elicitations were used to parameterize transfer functions. Experts were asked to estimate the number of days of disturbance an animal can tolerate before a vital rate is affected, the number of days of disturbance required to cause the maximum effect of disturbance, and the confidence that had in the values they had provided.

iPCoD + DEB is the iPCoD 5.2 where the transfer functions were replaced by the use of dynamic energy budget.
Additionally, the model allows the user to include density dependance effect on the vital rates.
