# iPCoD + DEB: interim Population Consequences of Disturbance including Dynamic Energy Budget

## Background

The potential risk of injury and/or disturbance to marine mammals exposed to noise has been identified as a key risk.  Possible consequences of exposure to underwater noise include: disturbance that could cause marine mammals to either move away or change behaviour, suffer temporary hearing damage or permanent physical injury. The interim Population Consequences of Disturbance (iPCoD) model assesses what the longer term and larger scale impacts of these consequences are to the exposed group(s) of animals as a whole.

iPCoD is a protocol for implementing an interim version of the Population Consequences of Disturbance (PCoD) approach for assessing and quantifying the potential consequences for marine mammal populations of any disturbance and/or injury that may result from offshore energy developments.The protocol has been developed by a team of researchers at the University of St Andrews and SMRU Consulting Europe, led by Prof. John Harwood (Harwood et al. 2014, King et al. 2015) and the latest version of the iPCoD (version 5.2) has been been extensively used by regulators and developers.

The model is primarily designed to help assess the impacts of disturbance and auditory injury in the form of permanent threshold shift (PTS) on marine mammal populations. The inputs include information about the management unit (MU) (for a given species and population) and the developments that could impact them (e.g. a calendar of days of activity, the numbers of animals impacted etc. – which come from external sources, such as impact assessments). The outputs provide the forecast of the population trajectory with and without the simulated disturbance and PTS. 

One of the key areas that the scientific community working on PCoD has focussed on in recent years is the relationships between the amount of disturbance experienced by an individual and its vital rates (survival and the probability of giving birth). These relationships are often referred to as transfer functions. In iPCoD, expert elicitations were used to parameterize transfer functions. Experts were asked to estimate the number of days of disturbance an animal can tolerate before a vital rate is affected, the number of days of disturbance required to cause the maximum effect of disturbance, and the confidence that had in the values they had provided.

Between 2020 and 2022 SMRU Consulting developed Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) models for the five iPCoD species (Harwood et al. 2020, Harwood et al. 2022). These reports describe the parameters that are used in the DEB model and provided suggested values for harbour seal, grey seal, bottlenose dolphin, minke whale and harbour porpoise in the UK. For each species, the reports differentiate between parameter values that were obtained from the literature and those that were based on expert judgement. Harwood et al. (2022) also developed an approach to quantify the uncertainties associated with predictions of the effects of disturbance derived from DEB models and applied this to the harbour seal model. Chudzińska et al. (2024) extended this approach to the grey seal and harbour porpoise DEB models and used it to evaluate the potential population-level consequences of exposure to a number of hypothetical piling scenarios. We will use their approach in this project.

iPCoD + DEB is the iPCoD 5.2 where the transfer functions were replaced by the use of DEB.The included code is an example based on harbour porpoise. The full description of the model is going to be available open-access under this link: https://www.gov.scot/collections/marine-publications/

## Getting started and use of the model

The iPCoD v5.2 has been widely used as part of assessments of the impact of disturbance on UK cetacean populations. We have therefore ensured that the iPCoD+DEB v1.0 closely resembles the current version which was informed by expert elicitation. This should allow users to run both versions of iPCoD with no additional training and with almost identical sets of input values.
Please refer to the Helpfile folder to see how to install and use the model. Please refer to the licence file to get an overview of who can use the model and how. 

## Funding

This model was developed as part of a dedicated study funded by the Marine Directorate, Scottish Government and Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management, the Netherlands (Rijkswaterstaat).
